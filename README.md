# html-css-template2
## My second html and CSS template.
In this template, I have practiced my skills in creating responsive web designs, utilizing variables for consistent color schemes, and implementing padding values. Additionally, I have employed flexbox for optimal element arrangement.

To create this template, I used "Kasper" PSD design available ona the Graphberry website. with the help of  Elzero Web School YouTube channel.

By combining these resources and my efforts, I have crafted a functional and visually appealing HTML and CSS template. Feel free to explore and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Your input is greatly appreciated!

Thank you for visiting this project, and happy coding!
